# Attentive Traffic Flow Machines


This is a PyTorch implementation of **Attentive Traffic Flow Machines (ATFM)**. ATFM is a a
unified neural network which can effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of crowd flow with an attention mechanism.

## Requirements
- torch==0.4.1

## Preprocessing
**For Crowd Flow Prediction:**  download [TaxiBJ](https://github.com/lucktroy/DeepST/tree/master/data/TaxiBJ/) / [BikeNYC](https://github.com/lucktroy/DeepST/tree/master/data/BikeNYC) and put them into folder  ```data/TaxiBJ``` and ```data/BikeNYC```.

**For Citywide Passenger Demand Prediction (CPDP):**  the dataset of CPDP has been in folder  ```data/TaxiNYC```.

## Model Training
```bash
# TaxiBJ
python run_taxibj.py

# BikeNYC
python run_bikenyc.py

# TaxiNYC
python run_taxinyc.py
```

## Testing
```bash
# TaxiBJ
python test_taxibj.py

# BikeNYC
python test_bikenyc.py

# TaxiNYC
python test_taxinyc.py
```
